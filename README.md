# neural-network
This code uses GRU network for minist digit classification through Keras. First, the network is trained and saved in .h5 files.
Then the .h5 files is loaded to reproduce the results of the trained netowrk. Next, the weights and bias of the netwrok is tuned to 
make better classification. Note that this code is used for fine-tuning of the netwrok and the parameter of the original network is not 
tuned carefully.
